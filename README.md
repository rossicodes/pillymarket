## 🌐 Pages & Routes

- **/** - Homepage with trending markets and quick actions
- **/markets** - Browse all prediction markets with filters
- **/markets/[address]** - Individual market detail and betting
- **/account** - User portfolio and transaction history
- **/admin** - Market management dashboard (admin access)

## 💰 Economic Model

### Market Mechanics
- **Probability-based pricing** - Share prices reflect implied probabilities
- **Automated market maker** - Liquidity provided by betting pool
- **House fee** - Configurable fee (1.5-2.5%) deducted from winnings
- **Winner-take-all** - Winning outcome shares pay out from total pool

### Example Calculation
```
Total Pool: 100 SOL
Your Bet: 10 SOL on Outcome A
Outcome A Pool: 40 SOL
House Fee: 2.5%

If Outcome A wins:
Your Share: 10/40 = 25%
Payout: (100 SOL * 0.25) * 0.975 = 24.375 SOL
Profit: 24.375 - 10 = 14.375 SOL
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Transaction transparency** - All actions recorded on-chain
- **Market integrity** - Administrative controls prevent manipulation
- **Bet validation** - Client and server-side validation
- **Secure resolution** - Multi-step market resolution process
